Fabric
======

Fabric is a dead simple one-page responsive framework with a couple super useful features. No pre-fab buttons or styles, just one small set of files ready for you to get to work with.


About
======

Fabric was developed out of the love of single page site design and the want &amp; need of a very basic system to not only deploy single page designs but address some important responsive design problems. Most modern responsive frameworks dive straight into complex systems of displaying content and often are found bloated with pre-made buttons, specific styles, and fancy behaviors. 

Instead of spending hours learning these builds just to get your content up and running we developed a super simple way of doing just that:
Quickly mobilize your content &amp; the rest is up to you to do what your design dictates.
